 1. 3 Define three variables using let, assigning them to a string, a boolean, and a number respectively.
 2. 10 Write five different comparisons between two values that produce a boolean result, and then add a
 comment that gives the result and explains your answer (e.g., 5 > 3 
/
 true; 5 is greater than 3). You
 must use at least three different comparison operators, and include at least one comparison using the
 strict equality operator (===).
 3. 2 Output the equation "5 * 4 = 20" by calculating the answer (20) and using a template literal for the
 result.
 4. 2 Provide two different ways of converting a number to a string.
 5. 3 Write a boolean expression that uses all three of the logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).
 6. 5 Write a function that takes a single number as a parameter and returns a boolean depending on
 whether the input number is positive (true) or negative
 zero (false).
 7. 10 Write two loops, one for loop, and one while loop which each output the numbers 1 through 10
 inclusive.
 8. 5 Prompt the user for a number, then using a single if statement, output a message if the input number
 is either 5, or 13, or is divisible by 3.
 9. 10 Prompt the user for their favourite season. You can assume they will only provide one of "summer",
 "winter", "autumn", and "spring". Use a chained if .. else if statement to output a different message
 depending on their selection. Now write an alternative way of solving this problem using a switch
 statement instead of the if .. else if chain
